### James Coulter

:wave: Hey there! I'm a web developer and designer who really enjoys building beautiful applications supported with a robust architecture. Most of my work involves the MERN stack, but am always looking for the next opportunity to learn new technologies. My design style is motivated with a user first focus. I am always looking to learn and improve. Let's connect, coffee is on me.
